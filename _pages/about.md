Hello! I'm a Research Fellow with the [Evidence in Governance and Politics](https://egap.org) network at [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca). I earned my PhD in the [Department of Politics](http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html) at New York University in 2024. Before my PhD, I completed an M.A. at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca) and a Bachelor's at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca).

I write on Canadian and Comparative Politics, with a focus on how information shapes people's beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. My PhD research and several ongoing projects investigate how members of dominant groups think about historical injustices committed against outgroups. This work takes place in the context of race relations in both Canada and the United States.
